                <p><b>Expression</b><br>April, 2023 - Present<br><br>
                    At Expression, I play a key role in integrating AI into classified projects for US government
                    agencies. I pioneered bringing LLM automation workflows to Expression, showcasing my leadership and
                    technical skills.
                    <br><br>
                    As the LLM and Computer Vision expert, I guide our company through implementation
                    of Object Detection/Tracking and LLM workflows, assist in procuring future work, and present weekly
                    technical demos to potential customers alongside our C-suite. I also collaborate with the business
                    development team on white papers and proposals.
                    <br><br>
                    I maintain high standards in documentation and information management, reducing rework and improving
                    team efficiency. I create synthetic data to emulate confidential datasets, enabling secure
                    development and testing of ML models. I manage the
                    ETL that streams data from government sources into AWS, transforms within Databricks, and loads into
                    ElasticSearch for use by our application.

                    As a TA for the Master’s Program in CS, I facilitated courses in Machine Learning, NLP, Advanced
                    Data Analytics, Cloud Computing, and Computer Systems. My duties included leading hands-on ML
                    tutorials, deep-learning GPU training sessions, and developing and grading course materials. This
                    role required a deep understanding of theory and the ability to communicate complex ideas to
                    students clearly.

                    As the lead MLE at an early-stage SaaS start-up, I specialized in developing and deploying custom
                    deep learning and computer vision models. Collaborating closely with our Data Engineer, I played a
                    pivotal role in constructing our AWS pipeline, tackling complex multi-camera problems to enhance
                    traffic flow predictions.
                    <br><br>
                    My expertise in analyzing raw video data involved the use of OCR, hierarchical clustering, and
                    advanced object detection/tracking techniques. This enabled the extraction of crucial data such as
                    license plates, shipping container numbers, and vehicle counts for comprehensive traffic analysis.
                    <br><br>
                    Our AI-powered web application revolutionized supply chain management by providing executives with
                    enriched video data of their trucks, incorporating essential details like time, location, and
                    various identification numbers. This innovation not only streamlined port deliveries across the
                    country but also served as an automated and reliable proof of delivery system.

                    As an MLE at UChicago Medicine, I developed sophisticated language models leveraging the hospital's
                    extensive patient database. My custom BERT model was specifically trained to assist in the accurate
                    suggestion of ICD codes for physicians, significantly enhancing their paperwork efficiency and
                    accuracy.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, my work focused on creating predictive models to identify patients at high risk of
                    cardiovascular diseases. This not only involved advanced data preprocessing and XGBoost analysis,
                    but also close collaboration with medical experts to ensure the models were clinically relevant.
                    Through these initiatives, we achieved a notable improvement in patient care by facilitating early
                    intervention strategies and more personalized treatment plans, while also adhering to stringent

                    As an ML Researcher at Argonne National Laboratory, I was part of a team focused on advancing water
                    quality monitoring technologies. I addressed the issue of drifting pH and voltage measurements in
                    water contamination sensors using GPU-powered Bayesian inference to develop a compensation solution.
                    This innovation enhanced the reliability and precision of at-home water sensors, particularly

                    As a Researcher, I conducted an innovative study analyzing dolphin movement and its emulation
                    through my 3D-printed fin designs. Key to this research was experimenting in a water tunnel. I
                    employed planar laser-induced fluorescence, a technique where dye is injected in alignment with a
                    laser beam, to vividly capture the vortex patterns in the wake of the fins. By recording these
                    phenomena at various heights in the water tunnel, I developed a program to interpolate and stitch
                    these 2D recordings into comprehensive 3D visualizations. The experiments, repeated under varying
                    water velocities and swimming patterns, were crucial in identifying the optimal Strouhal number for
                    swimming efficiency.
